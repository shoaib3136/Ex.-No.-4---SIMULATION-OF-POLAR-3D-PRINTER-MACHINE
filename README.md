## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT:
##                                                fig(a)-Assembly of Polar 3D Printer

### Y-Axis Base :

The y-axis base, or the azimuthal axis, is perpendicular to the z-axis and lies in the xy-plane. It helps determine the rotation around the z-axis, affecting the position of the point in the horizontal plane.
### Z-Axis Frame :

This is the frame that holds the print head and moves it up and down along the vertical axis.
### Smooth Rods :

The smooth rods that provide smooth and accurate movement of the Z-axis frame.
### Motors :

provide the power to move the Z-axis frame and the print head.
### Extruder Supporter :

The support structure that holds the extruder assembly.
### Threaded Rod :

Threaded rod that provides the power to move the Z-axis frame up and down.
### Y-Axis Frame :

The frame that moves the print head in the horizontal plane.
### Motor with Gear :

provides the power to move the Y-axis frame.
### Motor-with-Pulley :

provides the power to move the Z-axis frame.
### Gears :

Transfer power from the stepper motors to the threaded rod and the smooth rods.
### Plate :

plate where the printed object is created.
### Extruder :

melts and extrudes the filament to create the printed object.
### Filament :

material that is used to create the printed object.

### Name:Shaik Shoaib Nawaz
### Register Number:212222240094

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on construction of polar 3D printer is completed & movement of axis along X, Y, & Z has been studied.
